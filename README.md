Advanced Smart Waste Management System (ASWMS)

Develop an AI-driven system for optimizing waste collection and recycling processes in urban areas, reducing costs, and promoting sustainability by leveraging real-time data analysis.

ASWMS is an innovative project aimed at revolutionizing waste management in urban environments through the integration of advanced data engineering, complex data analytics, and state-of-the-art AI techniques. This system not only optimizes waste collection but also significantly reduces environmental impact while promoting sustainability.

## Project Goals

- Dynamic Route Optimization : Real-time adjustment of collection routes based on waste bin status, traffic, and weather conditions.
- Predictive Waste Generation : Forecast waste volumes to preemptively manage resources.
- Automated Waste Classification : Identify types of waste for better recycling practices using computer vision.
- Environmental Impact Assessment : Quantify and reduce the carbon footprint of waste management activities.

## Technology Stack

- Data Collection : IoT Sensors, Kafka, AWS Kinesis
- Data Processing : Apache Flink, AWS Lambda, AWS EMR with Spark
- Data Storage : AWS S3, PostgreSQL for structured data
- Data Analysis : Python (Pandas, NumPy), R for statistical analysis, Tableau for visualization
- Machine Learning : TensorFlow, Keras for deep learning models
- Deployment : Docker, Kubernetes on AWS EKS
- Monitoring : Prometheus, Grafana

## System Architecture

## Key Components
### Data Ingestion

- IoT Data Streaming : Real-time data from sensors to Kafka and AWS Kinesis.

### Data Processing

- Stream Processing : Apache Flink for anomaly detection and real-time analytics.
- Batch Processing : AWS EMR for deep historical data analysis.

### AI & Machine Learning

- Predictive Models : SARIMA and LSTM for forecasting waste generation.
- Route Optimization : Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for dynamic route planning.
- Waste Classification : Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for waste type identification.

### Impact Analysis

- Environmental : Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for environmental impact quantification.
- Economic : Cost-benefit analysis showing savings in fuel, labor, and maintenance.
- Social : Community engagement through an interactive app for waste reporting and education.

## Codebase

- /data_ingestion : Scripts for collecting and streaming sensor data.
- /data_processing : Flink jobs and AWS Lambda functions.
- /ai_models : Implementation of various ML models.
- /analysis : Scripts for predictive analytics and impact assessments.
- /deployment : Docker files and Kubernetes configurations.
- /monitoring : Prometheus configurations and Grafana dashboards.

## How to Run
1. Setup Environment : Ensure you have Python 3.8+, Java for Flink, and Docker installed.
2. Database Setup : Configure PostgreSQL or use AWS RDS.
3. Data Streams : Setup Kafka locally or configure AWS Kinesis.
4. Run Jobs : 
   - Use `docker-compose up` for local testing.
   - For production, deploy using Kubernetes manifests in `/deployment`.

## Deployment and Monitoring
Scalable Infrastructure: Use Kubernetes on AWS for deployment, ensuring the system scales with city size and data volume.
Monitoring: Implement comprehensive logging, alerting systems using Prometheus and Grafana for system health and performance metrics.


## Project Impact
- Environmental: Reduced carbon emissions through optimized routes, increased recycling efficiency.
- Economic : Significant savings in operational costs, potential new revenue streams from recycling.
- Social : Improved public health due to less waste overflow, community empowerment through education.

## Future Work
- Scalability : Expand to handle waste management in larger cities or multiple cities.
- Integration : Incorporate more external data sources like weather forecasts, city events for better predictions.
- Feedback Loop : Implement a system where AI models are continuously retrained based on new data and feedback.
